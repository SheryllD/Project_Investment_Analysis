# Technical Issues, Problems & Troubleshooting

## Trouble Shooting

#### 1. Missing express module error

If you get an error like:
Error: Cannot find module 'express'

#### 2. axios or cheerio missing
run in terminal:  npm install axios cheerio

#### 3. Permission Issues with ChromeDriver
If using ChromeDriver for headless browsing, ensure you have installed the correct version:
Download ChromeDriver: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

## Technical Issues, Problems: 
Most venture capital websites are difficult to scrape due to Cloudflare protection or dynamic content rendering. Initially, I attempted to bypass these restrictions by modifying the user agent to mimic human behavior. However, this approach was unsuccessful, and my requests were blocked.

Next, I tried using Selenium to handle dynamic pages, but this also failed to extract the required data effectively due to the complexity of the websiteâ€™s structure and anti-bot mechanisms.
