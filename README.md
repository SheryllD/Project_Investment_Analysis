#### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
- Handling missing values 
- Removing duplicates and inconsistencies
- Standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, text case normalization)
- Handling outliers
- Addressing categorical variables 

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps)
- Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Feature selection and engineering

#### 4. Data Processing & Transformation
- Merging or aggregating data from multiple sources
- Creating new features (please see "Features" for more information)

#### 5. Analytical Approach & Techniques
- Statistical methods applied 
- Clustering and classification
- Performance metrics used: (more information here needed) 
- Assumptions or limitations considered

#### 7. Conclusion & Insights
Summary of findings: 

- several key statistcs findings:
- segmentation of amount invested by countries: Australia
- segmentation of amount invested by industry: Heatlh Tech
- Average growth rate:  EdTech
- industry highest valuation: E-commerce
- country highest valuation: Australia
- Fairly even distribtion of invesment amoung  all countries and industries

Key takeaways relevant to the problem statements: 

- show that Australia is the countries which invested more 
- Industry with highest growth and growth potential: Australia
- show the industry with more invesment and least growth: Health Tech 

Potential business implications or next steps:

- As invesment advisors we direct private investor into the most profitable oportunities in private equity
- in this case EdTech shows a good potential and Health tech shows the slowest growth thats a sign of a overheated and overfunded industry. 
- Showwing which countries harvest the greatest oportunity to do business in our data Australia is at the top

#### Functions: 

- data cleaning functions: Regex, Args, Loops, index, DF
- data aggreagation functions: for loops, index, Args, Sum, Average
- Visualitations functions: Args, Import matplot.pyplot, plt figure, plt pie, plt tittle, plt show

### Technical Issues & Problems 

- we tried to use a format for the money amounts having it show a M or B (millions and billions) for a better user experience but it didnt work for getting statistics as we needed am integer and not a string 
- we change the startups generic names into an Id numbers for better searchability
